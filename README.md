Welcome to the Accessible and Socially Aware Technologies (ASSET) lab in the <a href="https://www.cs.uri.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Statistics</a> at the <a href="https://www.uri.edu/">University of Rhode Island (URI)</a>.

We explore the frontiers of research in computer science in our quest to build technologies for marginalized populations, using ideas from accessibility, human-computer interaction, and applied machine learning. We often use ideas, theories, and methodologies from fields like the humanities and the social sciences in our approach to addressing technical design problems.

Our research is primarily funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Disabled Persons Protection Commission, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
